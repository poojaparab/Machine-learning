Assume that your team has asked you to put a Model in production. You have to give a working implementation of the following:

1.Implement a Regression Model on this public dataset. The regression performance for now is not a concern. A basic model would do, to start with.
2.Put this Model behind an API. The API would get inputs as required by the Model and the output would be the predicted value. You can use any open-source web/api framework of your choice, preferably from the Python ecosystem.
3.In the near future, there can be multiple versions of this Model running in production simultaneously so as to choose the better one based on real-traffic. Ensure that you provide this capability in the API ?
4.Ensure that you are logging things, making it possible to evaluate production performance of the Model.
5.The application is expected to serve heavy traffic. How would you ensure that it is able to run well ?
6.Any other things that can you do to better monitor your application in production ?
